        <h2>Referral/Affiliate Program</h2>
        <p><b>1.	Introduction:</b> These Referral Program Terms are additional terms which apply if you use the Collabstr Referral Program. These Referral Program Terms form part of your agreement with us.</p>
        
        <p><b>2.	Interpretation:</b> In these Referral Program Terms defined terms have the same meanings given to them in the Terms of Use, In addition:</p>
        
        <p>1.	<b>"Referring User"</b> is also referred to as "you" or "your" in these Referral Program Terms;
            2.	<b>"Referred User"</b> means the person who joins Collabstr as a brand or influencer via the Referring User's unique referral link.
        </p>
        
        <p><b>3.	What is the Collabstr Referral Program?</b> Collabstr offers a referral program by which existing Users can introduce people who are interested in becoming influencers or working with influencers to Collabstr and receive referral payments from Collabstr which are calculated and limited as described in these Referral Program Terms.</p>

        <p><b>4.	The rules of the Collabstr Referral Program:</b></p>
        <p>1.	Only Users of Collabstr with a current User account can participate in the Collabstr Referral Program. If a User's account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by the User, that User will not be eligible to participate in the Collabstr Referral Program.
            2.	You will need on your referral page to submit PayPal details in order to receive referral payments under the Collabstr Referral Program.
            3.	Each User has a unique referral link (which can be accessed via the User's User account) which the User may share with others. When sharing your unique referral link you must not impersonate Collabstr or give the impression that your referral link is being shared or promoted by us. You must not use Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service to share or promote your unique referral link. Upon our request, you must disclose the methods by which you share your unique referral link in the Bio/Website field of your Collabstr account.
            4.	The Referred User must click on your unique referral link and then register with Collabstr using the same browser that they used to click on your unique referral link. If someone registers with Collabstr other than by using your unique referral link, we will not link that account to your referral and we will not make any referral payment to you.
            5.	The Referred User must not have opened a User account with Collabstr (whether under the same name or another name) before clicking on your unique referral link. If the Referred User is currently or has previously been a User of Collabstr we will not make any referral payment to you for the referral.
            6.	If the Referred User sets up more than one User account we will make referral payments to you on the earnings made by the Referred User from their first User account only. We will not pay any referral payments to you on any further User accounts set up by the Referred User.
            7.	We will not pay any referral payments to you on any referral of a Referred User which we determine is owned or operated by you, or is in a commercial relationship with you. You will provide any information which we request to enable us to determine whether the Referred User is owned or operated by you or if there is a commercial relationship between you and the Referred User.
            8.	You agree that when promoting Collabstr in any way as a Referring User: 
            	you will not give a false impression of Collabstr, the services, programs, and content (including Content) made available through Collabstr, its Users or the Terms of Service; and
            	you will not make any statements which suggest to a potential Referred User that the potential Referred User will make a particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of Collabstr, or any statements regarding the likely number of sales.
            </p>

        <p><b>5.	Referral payments:</b></p>
        <p><b>1.	How are referral payments calculated? </b>Once a Referred User has become a registered User of Collabstr in accordance with the rules of the Collabstr Referral Program described above, we will pay the Referring User a referral payment equal to fifty percent of Collabstr’s net profit on the transaction, up to ten percent of the whole transaction. Referring Users are only entitled to payments for transactions that are considered completed by Collabstr.</p>
        <p><b>2.	How frequently are referral payments made? </b>We will transfer to your Collabstr account the referral payment due to you on orders completed by your Referred Users in a calendar month on or around the first day of the next calendar month (which means, for example, that referral payments due to you in respect of Fan Payments made to the Referred User in February shall be paid to you on or around 1 March). For your first payment you may be required to meet a minimum threshold of $100 before receiving your referral payment.</p>
        <p><b>3.	Who bears the cost of the referral payment? </b>The cost of the referral payment is borne by us, not the Referred User.</p>

        <p><b>6.	Our rights relating to the referral program.</b></p>
        <p>1.	If referral payments have been made incorrectly then we have the right to recover the wrongly paid sums from the User to whom the wrongly paid sums have been paid.
            2.	We may request you or Referred Users (or both) to provide us with ID and other information reasonably required by us to verify any referral payment to be made and the person to whom any referral payment should be made. Failure to provide any information requested by us may lead to you losing your entitlement to referral payments in respect of the relevant Referred User.
            3.	We may change any aspect of the Collabstr Referral Program (including how referral payments are calculated) or discontinue the Collabstr Referral Program at any time, but no change will deprive any Referring User of referral payments already earned based on payments made to Referred Users before the changes came into effect.
            </p>

        <p><b>7.	Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:</b></p>
        <p>1.	We may withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out:
            	if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;
            	if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User); or
            	if we suspect that all or any part of the referral payments due to you result from unlawful activity, either by you, by the customer who made the payment to the Referred User which resulted in the referral payment, or by the Referred User to whom the payment was made which resulted in the referral payment,
            for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach(es) by you or the suspected unlawful activity (as applicable). If following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service; (ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User), and/or (iii) all or any part of referral payments due to you result from unlawful activity, we may notify you that you have forfeited all or any part of your referral payments.
            2.	We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment due to you under the Collabstr Referral Program where we have a right to do so under these Referral Program Terms.
            3.	If we are withholding all or any part of the referral payments due to you and we determine that part of the referral payments withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity, then we may pay to you the part of the referral payments which is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity. However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.
