    <meta content="Who would you bet on to create a successful local influencer marketing campaign: small local influencers or social media moguls?

If you chose the latter, you’re not entirely wrong. For brands with a massive budget, celebrity influencers could be an option. But, when talking about local marketing campaigns for smaller brands, we’re primarily looking at two things: engagement and trust. 

Well, not really. Micro-influencers typically have higher engagement and more meaningful connections with their followers. Small and local influencers can be even better than the world’s Kims and Kylies.



Take a look at the above chart, and notice how the engagement rates drastically drop as the follower number increases. What would you say Kim Kardashian’s engagement rate is on Instagram? According to ProvenSEO, Kim K stands far behind micro-influencers at a little over 1%. 

One in five people say they trust recommendations from people in the community, and that’s why they prefer to support local businesses. Local influencers are a part of that community, and their reviews hold massive weight. 

How to find and connect with local influencers for your brand?

Even if you have no idea who your best local influencers are, all you need is a quick search to get the wheels turning. There are multiple places you can resort to when browsing influencers, and you can do it on your own. 

Social platforms like Instagram are where you’ll want to look at first. Thankfully, Instagram makes it possible for users to filter their searches and find what they’re looking for more easily.

Search by Location

Go to Instagram’s search icon. Right below the search bar, you’ll find the Location tab, where you can find photos taken or posted from a particular place. 



Once you start typing in your location, Instagram will bring up automatic suggestions, so you can perfectly match the location you’re currently at. This way, you’re more likely to find influencers in your area.

As an important note: even though you’ll be searching for influences through Instagram, don’t forget to look at their other social channels, such as TikTok and Youtube. 

Include Your Location, plus “Influencer” on Hashtags

Another way to do this is by looking for hashtags that contain your location, followed by the word “influencer”. 

As an example, when looking at the results for the hashtag #OrlandoInfluencer, you’ll see a lot of influencers using this hashtag, along with multiple other hashtags, in their photos. This is a strategy they use to be discovered by people like you, in order to advertise that they could be open for business. 



Here’s a handy tip for those looking to work with smaller influencers: instead of focusing on the “Popular” tab, go to the most “Recent” pictures. This way, you’re sure to find smaller influencers whose pictures have been posted minutes before your search. 

Do a Simple Google Search

On the flip side, if you’re particularly looking for the most sought-after influencers from where you live, Google can be extremely helpful.

With a search like “best influencers in (your location)”, you’ll come across various articles listing some of the most popular influencers in that area.

Golden Tip: Become a Member of Influencer Marketplaces

Influencer marketplaces, or influencer platforms, are by far the easiest way to find influencers around the globe. 

It can be tough to find and connect with niche influencers in your area, especially if you want to focus on the smaller ones. By “smaller”, we mean those starting at a 1k follower count, which are the ones you should be focusing on.

Influencer platforms like Collabstr are designed to help local brand owners like you find the ideal influencers to represent you. If you find yourself too busy, you’d be interested in knowing that influencer marketplaces drastically reduce repetitive research work, they also mitigate a lot of the risk when it comes to working with influencers. 

Here are just a few of the benefits of influencer platforms over traditional influencer research methods:


    Quick filtering. Regardless if you’re looking for celebrities or micro-influencers in a small niche, all you have to do is use a handy search bar. Advanced filters will let you choose influencers’ gender, pricing range, country, and city in just a few clicks.  





    Central communication. Forget instagram DMing or emails.. Influencer platforms like Collabstr have their own instant chat system in place, allowing both professionals to focus on the collaboration at hand. 
    Safe connections and safe transactions. There’s no need to worry about whether an influencer will simply leave you on read or outright steal your money. Yes, that could happen in typical scenarios. With influencer platforms, however, influencers’ profiles are fully vetted upfront for false engagement or any suspicious history. Plus, all of your payments are retained until the influencers have completed and sent the work. It’s a win-win. 


Above All, Get to Know Them 

No matter which search method you use when finding influencers, it’s important to look at their channels (Instagram, TikTok, and/or YouTube) and their current ads for other products. Do you like what you see? Would you like your brand to be portrayed by that person? In particular, look for quality content you’d be proud to showcase. 

Next, and this one is important: don’t be swayed by a large follower count.

While a large following is what most brands look for, this shouldn’t be the sole criteria that dictates whether or not you work with this person. Things such as audience location, audience gender, and engagement can be equally as important.

Now That You’ve Chosen Your Influencer, How Do You Connect With Them? 

It takes more than just one message to get a partnership started. You need to have a strategic approach before and during the connection. Here’s how to do it. 

Reach Out

This part can be a bit nerve-racking for brand owners, as there’s always a chance the influencer might reject the offer. 

What should you do? Your initial message needs to be attention grabbing, after all, most content creators are being approached by multiple brands at any given moment.

If you’re emailing them, make sure the email subject is direct and clear. Avoid subject lines such as “Question” or “Proposal”. You’re much better off writing something like “Interested in a paid collaboration with {company}?”. 

Here’s how to effectively reach out to an influencer:


    Be human. Greet the influencer and get right into things, there’s no need for technical language or corporate-speak in the first email. This increases the chance of them reading your whole message.
    Include the “meaty” part of the message up front. This should tell them what you’re doing, and why you want them to partake in it. This is the perfect opportunity to give them an overview of your product and tell them why they would a good fit for your campaign.
    Lastly, ask for their thoughts, and if they would be interested in partnering with you.
    Wrap up the email with your name, rather than your brand name. This adds to the trust and warmth of your message. Also include a link to your website, or your socials if you don’t have a website. This gives them a place to go research your brand.


A rough draft should look something like this:

Hey there, (influencer name)!

I know this might be one of tons of messages you’re reading today, so I’ll make this quick.

I’m the owner of (brand name), and we’re about to launch an exciting campaign for (product). (Here, you can elaborate a little about your product and what’s unique and desirable about it. Don’t make it too long.) We’re in the process of selecting influencers to help with the promotion, and we thought of you because (briefly explain why they’re the perfect choice. Is it their authenticity? The quality of their videos? Is it because they’ve worked with similar brands and you’ll think they love your products?)
 
We’re looking for someone that can (Explain what the requirements of this collaboration are. What do you need this influencer to do? This gives them enough information to decide if they would like to move forward).
    
What do you think? Is this something you’d be interested in? Eagerly waiting for your response.
    
Thank you,
Your name
Your website

Of course, the above is for demonstration purposes. Apply this draft to your current campaign accordingly. 

No Reply? It Happens.

As “micro” as an influencer might be, your message could still be one of many they’re receiving on a particular day. So be patient. 

If they don’t reply in up to two or three days, follow up with them. If they don’t reply to your follow up message after a few days, don’t get stuck on them. Otherwise, you’ll be wasting precious time you could be using to find someone else who’s truly interested in what you have to offer. 

In the end of the day, not everyone is going to be interested in working with you. Sometimes people are busy, other times they’re simply not interested, don’t take it personally.

They Liked My Proposal. Now What? 

That’s awesome. This is the time when you start talking a bit more in-depth about the campaign and what you expect from them. This is also where the influencer will most likely begin throwing prices at you based on what your expectations are. 

A great way to convey your thoughts and requirements to influencers is by providing them with a campaign brief. The brief should include the following details:


    Name of your brand/company.
    Your website and social channels
    Any important details about the brand and its audience(s).
    Details about which actions the influencer should take, what they should say, as well as any keywords they should mention, if relevant.
    Expected project completion date.
    Expected measurable results, if relevant.


Know the Types of Content They Can Create

Tutorials

How-to videos are among the most watched videos on the internet for a reason. Anyone who’s trying something for the first time needs another person’s help. They want to see how others do something, and the results they get from it. No two people’s final results will be the same, and that’s exciting to watch. 

These videos are popular especially with beauty products, like the following ad for e.l.f which features a makeup tutorial.

  @trinity POV: You just walked in on your sister getting ready to FaceTime her crush! @elfyeah  #elfyeah #elfcosmetics ♬ just a boy - Alaina Castillo   

Benefits

Most of the time, people just want to know what’s in it for them. If your product isn’t the only one of its kind, what makes it unique? What benefits will it deliver? Why should you choose it over its competition? 

In the following TikTok, the influencer lists several reasons why her Function Of Beauty products are so beneficial to her.

  @_ambereileen #ad Sharing my fave custom hair care, #functionofbeauty! Love how it caters to my hair needs. Get 20% off with CODE: AMBEREILEEN20 #ad #partner #fy #f ♬ Sunrise - Official Sound Studio   

What to Do After an Influencer Campaign?

Once you receive an influencer’s work, you’ll be able to ask for revisions if needed. After you approve it, the work can finally be published and analyzed.

Be sure to share the content as much as possible, and if it’s okay with the content creator, you can even repost it to your brand’s social channels. Cross-posting content is a great way to get the most out of the content that you pay for.

Ultimately, influencer marketing shouldn’t be a one-and-done kind of thing. Don’t hesitate to set an influencer marketing budget aside – there’s a reason influencer marketing is gaining popularity amongst brands." property="og:description">

<p>What should you do? Your initial message needs to be attention grabbing, after all, most content creators are being approached by multiple brands at any given moment.</p>

<p>If you’re emailing them, make sure the email subject is direct and clear. Avoid subject lines such as “Question” or “Proposal”. You’re much better off writing something like “Interested in a paid collaboration with {company}?”. </p>

<p>Here’s how to effectively reach out to an influencer:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Be human. Greet the influencer and get right into things, there’s no need for technical language or corporate-speak in the first email. This increases the chance of them reading your whole message.</li>
    <li>Include the “meaty” part of the message up front. This should tell them what you’re doing, and why you want them to partake in it. This is the perfect opportunity to give them an overview of your product and tell them why they would a good fit for your campaign.</li>
    <li>Lastly, ask for their thoughts, and if they would be interested in partnering with you.</li>
    <li>Wrap up the email with your name, rather than your brand name. This adds to the trust and warmth of your message. Also include a link to your website, or your socials if you don’t have a website. This gives them a place to go research your brand.</li>
</ul>

<p>A rough draft should look something like this:</p>

<p><i>Hey there, (influencer name)!</i></p>

<p><i>I know this might be one of tons of messages you’re reading today, so I’ll make this quick.</i></p>

<p><i>I’m the owner of (brand name), and we’re about to launch an exciting campaign for (product). (Here, you can elaborate a little about your product and what’s unique and desirable about it. Don’t make it too long.) We’re in the process of selecting influencers to help with the promotion, and we thought of you because (briefly explain why they’re the perfect choice. Is it their authenticity? The quality of their videos? Is it because they’ve worked with similar brands and you’ll think they love your products?)</i></p>
 
<p><i>We’re looking for someone that can (Explain what the requirements of this collaboration are. What do you need this influencer to do? This gives them enough information to decide if they would like to move forward).</i></p>
    
<p><i>What do you think? Is this something you’d be interested in? Eagerly waiting for your response.</i></p>
    
<p><i>Thank you,</i></p>
<p><i>Your name</i></p>
<p><i>Your website</i></p>

<p>Of course, the above is for demonstration purposes. Apply this draft to your current campaign accordingly. </p>

<h2>No Reply? It Happens.</h2>

<p>As “micro” as an influencer might be, your message could still be one of many they’re receiving on a particular day. So be patient. </p>

<p>If they don’t reply in up to two or three days, follow up with them. If they don’t reply to your follow up message after a few days, don’t get stuck on them. Otherwise, you’ll be wasting precious time you could be using to find someone else who’s truly interested in what you have to offer. </p>

<p>In the end of the day, not everyone is going to be interested in working with you. Sometimes people are busy, other times they’re simply not interested, don’t take it personally.</p>

<h2>They Liked My Proposal. Now What? </h2>

<p>That’s awesome. This is the time when you start talking a bit more in-depth about the campaign and what you expect from them. This is also where the influencer will most likely begin throwing prices at you based on what your expectations are. </p>

<p>A great way to convey your thoughts and requirements to influencers is by providing them with a campaign brief. The brief should include the following details:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Name of your brand/company.</li>
    <li>Your website and social channels</li>
    <li>Any important details about the brand and its audience(s).</li>
    <li>Details about which actions the influencer should take, what they should say, as well as any keywords they should mention, if relevant.</li>
    <li>Expected project completion date.</li>
    <li>Expected measurable results, if relevant.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Know the Types of Content They Can Create</h2>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>How-to videos are among the most watched videos on the internet for a reason. Anyone who’s trying something for the first time needs another person’s help. They want to see how others do something, and the results they get from it. No two people’s final results will be the same, and that’s exciting to watch. </p>

<p>These videos are popular especially with beauty products, like the following ad for e.l.f which features a makeup tutorial.</p>

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@trinity/video/6821948027897416966" data-video-id="6821948027897416966" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@trinity" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trinity">@trinity</a> <p>POV: You just walked in on your sister getting ready to FaceTime her crush! @elfyeah  <a title="elfyeah" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/elfyeah">#elfyeah</a> <a title="elfcosmetics" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/elfcosmetics">#elfcosmetics</a></p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ just a boy - Alaina Castillo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/just-a-boy-6800579719969376258">♬ just a boy - Alaina Castillo</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="../../lf16-tiktok-web.ttwstatic.com/obj/tiktok-web-us/tiktok/falcon/embed/embed_v1.0.6.js"></script>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>Most of the time, people just want to know what’s in it for them. If your product isn’t the only one of its kind, what makes it unique? What benefits will it deliver? Why should you choose it over its competition? </p>

<p>In the following TikTok, the influencer lists several reasons why her Function Of Beauty products are so beneficial to her.</p>

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@_ambereileen/video/7011628813528452357" data-video-id="7011628813528452357" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@_ambereileen" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_ambereileen">@_ambereileen</a> <p><a title="ad" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ad">#ad</a> Sharing my fave custom hair care, <a title="functionofbeauty" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/functionofbeauty">#functionofbeauty</a>!

<h2>What to Do After an Influencer Campaign?</h2>

<p>Once you receive an influencer’s work, you’ll be able to ask for revisions if needed. After you approve it, the work can finally be published and analyzed.</p>

<p>Be sure to share the content as much as possible, and if it’s okay with the content creator, you can even repost it to your brand’s social channels. Cross-posting content is a great way to get the most out of the content that you pay for.</p>

<p>Ultimately, influencer marketing shouldn’t be a one-and-done kind of thing. Don’t hesitate to set an influencer marketing budget aside – there’s a reason <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092819/global-influencer-market-size/">influencer marketing is gaining popularity amongst brands</a>.</p>
